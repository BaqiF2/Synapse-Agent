- Repeated disruption, trolling, or spam
- Publishing someone else's private information without permission
- Sharing malicious code or exploit details in a way that creates active harm

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to:

- Repository spaces (issues, pull requests, comments)
- Project-related collaboration channels
- Public interactions when representing this project

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take actions including:

- Warnings

## Reporting

If you experience or witness violations:

3. Include links, screenshots, or timestamps when available.

Maintainers will review reports promptly and handle them with care for reporter privacy and safety.
