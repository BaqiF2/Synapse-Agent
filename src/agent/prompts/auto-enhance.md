Task completed. Please analyze this conversation to identify reusable tool usage patterns.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does it involve 5+ tool calls in a complex operation?
- Are there repeated operation patterns?
- Can it be abstracted into a reusable skill?

**Decision:**
- If valuable patterns are found, run `skill:enhance` to create or improve skills
- If no patterns worth enhancing, simply reply "No enhancement needed" and end

Note: This is an automatic enhancement check. Keep your response brief.
