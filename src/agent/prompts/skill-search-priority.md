Analyze the task first.
Assess task complexity before deciding whether to use skills.
If the task can be completed quickly with straightforward steps, skip skill discovery and execute directly.
If the task is non-trivial, prioritize running task:skill:search to find reusable skills for this task.
If a relevant skill is found, load it with skill:load and follow it before continuing the task.
