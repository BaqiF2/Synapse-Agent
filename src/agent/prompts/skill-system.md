## Self-Description

All commands support self-description:
- `-h` - Brief help: Shows name, usage, and parameter list. **Use this when you don't know what a tool does.**
- `--help` - Detailed help: Shows full description, all parameters with types, and examples. **Use this when you don't know how to use a tool.**

**CRITICAL: Query before calling.** When encountering an unfamiliar tool:
1. First use `<tool> -h` to understand what the tool does
2. If you need more details on usage, use `<tool> --help`
3. Only then make the actual tool call with correct parameters

Never call a tool directly without first understanding its purpose and parameters.
