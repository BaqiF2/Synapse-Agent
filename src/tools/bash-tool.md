Execute bash commands in a persistent shell session.

This is the ONLY tool available to you. All operations must be done through Bash commands.

The Bash session is persistent - environment variables and working directory are maintained across commands.

You can use:
- Native Shell Command: Standard Unix commands (ls, cd, pwd, grep, find, git, curl, etc.)
- Agent Shell Command: Special built-in commands (read, write, edit, glob, search, bash)
- extend Shell command: Domain-specific tools (mcp:*, skill:*, tools)

All commands support -h (brief help) and --help (detailed documentation).
